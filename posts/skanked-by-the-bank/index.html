                    <p>Occasionally, something happens that brings out my inner Victor Meldrew. In this case, I think it was justified. I&rsquo;ve had an account with ABA bank since I moved to Cambodia five years ago. This morning, the school contacted me to say that they couldn&rsquo;t transfer my wages to my account. How very odd. So I got on the app, and saw that my account was in credit, everything okay - but hold on a minute, what&rsquo;s this? The last transaction is a bank charge for $10, due to my account being charged for being dormant.</p>
<p>No way, lets contact customer services. No reply. Guess I have to go to the bank.
So that&rsquo;s what I did. After waiting for a short eternity, I finally got to talk to customer services staff (afraid I ended up getting a bit hot under the collar). It turns out that they&rsquo;ve decided to deactivate my account because it was dormant. But I&rsquo;ve been using the ATM at least 2 times a week for the last 2 years. So how?</p>
<p>Going through reams of printouts, the friendly staff diligently pointed out to me that my account had indeed been flagged as dormant.</p>
<p>THREE YEARS AGO</p>
<p>And with the same due care and attention, they have now (today) decided to steal $10 (sorry, I mean charges and fees) from me and deactivate the account. For something that happened three years ago. Three fucking years ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve encountered sharp practice upon many occasions since I moved to Asia, but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been ripped off by an actual financial institution. $10 is not a huge sum of money. There are two issues that concern me more. The first is trust. I don&rsquo;t think I would like to deposit a large sum of money with these guys. What other retrospective chicanery could they pull? The second issue is the inconvenience. I&rsquo;ve had to wait for my money, and this has had a knock on effect for my family as well. I can&rsquo;t wire any money until I receive my wages, and also my account needs to be active in order for me to make the transfer. Thank God that there aren&rsquo;t any other issues such as medical bills to deal with this week. And all of this happened without the simple courtesy of a call to inform me of the situation. At least I found out in good time (by pure luck) so I was able to fix it before the weekend.</p>
<p>I guess that this covid is having a knock on effect for everyone. Maybe the bongtoms higher up in bank management aren&rsquo;t getting enough tea money, so they are looking for ways to skank customers retrospectively. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just down to the ever present incompetence you get to encounter here on a daily basis. Either way, corruption or incompetence, it isn&rsquo;t good. Hope this isn&rsquo;t happening to too many other people, but I would be surprised if I was the only victim of this. So if you bank with ABA, check that your accounts haven&rsquo;t been suspended due to similar bullshit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a chill pill now. Relax. Take care and stay safe everyone.</p>
