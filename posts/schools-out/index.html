                    <p>This time is different. I think that Cambodia&rsquo;s amazing run of good luck has come to an end. The virus is with us now, and this time it appears to be here to stay. The genie ain&rsquo;t gonna go back in the bottle this time. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong. I would love to be wrong. It could&rsquo;ve all been prevented.
When will life return to normal? Ellen had only just started school when all of the covid closures kicked in last year. Start school, stop school, start again, stop again - now the schools are closed indefinitely.</p>

<p>I suppose that the precautions may have been necessary, but I think it would have been better to prevent unneccesary foreign travel rather than impact the childrens&rsquo; education.</p>
<p>Looking at the current outbreak here in Cambodia, the source can be traced back to Chinese tourists (sorry, &ldquo;investors&rdquo;) absconding from quarantine. The previous outbreak was due to &ldquo;VIPs&rdquo; returning from a pleasure trip abroad.</p>
<p>Why should ordinary children be made to suffer because of the actions of these irresponsible morons? Of course this is a rhetorical question. I&rsquo;m just mouthing off because it makes me angry. It&rsquo;s not the kids that spread this. It&rsquo;s the supercilious shitheads that think that they are better than everyone else. No shortage of those cnuts [sic(k)] in Asia, at least in my experience.</p>
