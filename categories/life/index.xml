      <description>Here I am, stuck inside four walls in my room in Ta Khmau. There&amp;rsquo;s no official lockdown here, but it makes sense to limit social contact. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna escape for a while tomorrow though, and head across the river to visit the family. I think that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty well socially distanced riding a bicycle. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. I&amp;rsquo;m in two minds whether to take the ferry though (very crowded), or ride all the way up to the Prek Tamak bridge and back south again.</description>

      <description>This time is different. I think that Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s amazing run of good luck has come to an end. The virus is with us now, and this time it appears to be here to stay. The genie ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna go back in the bottle this time. I hope I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. I would love to be wrong. It could&amp;rsquo;ve all been prevented. When will life return to normal? Ellen had only just started school when all of the covid closures kicked in last year.</description>
