      <description>Here I am, stuck inside four walls in my room in Ta Khmau. There&amp;rsquo;s no official lockdown here, but it makes sense to limit social contact. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna escape for a while tomorrow though, and head across the river to visit the family. I think that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty well socially distanced riding a bicycle. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it. I&amp;rsquo;m in two minds whether to take the ferry though (very crowded), or ride all the way up to the Prek Tamak bridge and back south again.</description>

      <description>Occasionally, something happens that brings out my inner Victor Meldrew. In this case, I think it was justified. I&amp;rsquo;ve had an account with ABA bank since I moved to Cambodia five years ago. This morning, the school contacted me to say that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t transfer my wages to my account. How very odd. So I got on the app, and saw that my account was in credit, everything okay - but hold on a minute, what&amp;rsquo;s this?</description>

      <description>This time is different. I think that Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s amazing run of good luck has come to an end. The virus is with us now, and this time it appears to be here to stay. The genie ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna go back in the bottle this time. I hope I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. I would love to be wrong. It could&amp;rsquo;ve all been prevented. When will life return to normal? Ellen had only just started school when all of the covid closures kicked in last year.</description>

      <description>Welcome!
I&amp;rsquo;m writing here because I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to return to coding. Coding has missed me (LOL).
I started messing around with code in 1982, using a Sinclair ZX81. After uni, I worked as a software / web developer for six years. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been around for quite some time. After a while I reached a phase in my life when I never wanted to look at a screen ever again. Splitting headaches, RSI, the works.</description>

      <description>Cycling has to be one of the best things that anybody can do. Transport, exercise and stress relief all combined in one easy package. I took a short break on my commute into Phnom Penh to capture this moment. Me and my trusty Giant bicycle were about to mark a metric milestone together.
 My bicycle: Giant Rincon Disc
 Check out the odometer reading: 9,999 kilometres. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of riding.</description>
