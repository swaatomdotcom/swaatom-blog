      <description>Welcome!
I&amp;rsquo;m writing here because I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to return to coding. Coding has missed me (LOL).
I started messing around with code in 1982, using a Sinclair ZX81. After uni, I worked as a software / web developer for six years. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been around for quite some time. After a while I reached a phase in my life when I never wanted to look at a screen ever again. Splitting headaches, RSI, the works.</description>

      <description>Cycling has to be one of the best things that anybody can do. Transport, exercise and stress relief all combined in one easy package. I took a short break on my commute into Phnom Penh to capture this moment. Me and my trusty Giant bicycle were about to mark a metric milestone together.
 My bicycle: Giant Rincon Disc
 Check out the odometer reading: 9,999 kilometres. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of riding.</description>
