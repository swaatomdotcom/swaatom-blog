      <description>Occasionally, something happens that brings out my inner Victor Meldrew. In this case, I think it was justified. I&amp;rsquo;ve had an account with ABA bank since I moved to Cambodia five years ago. This morning, the school contacted me to say that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t transfer my wages to my account. How very odd. So I got on the app, and saw that my account was in credit, everything okay - but hold on a minute, what&amp;rsquo;s this?</description>

      <description>This time is different. I think that Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s amazing run of good luck has come to an end. The virus is with us now, and this time it appears to be here to stay. The genie ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna go back in the bottle this time. I hope I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. I would love to be wrong. It could&amp;rsquo;ve all been prevented. When will life return to normal? Ellen had only just started school when all of the covid closures kicked in last year.</description>
